# Musical_genre_classificationusing_MLtechniques

Welcome to my Repository Guys, This is the Project I have done in my initial days at my college but I couldn't upload it on github as I had very liitle knowledge of github and honeslty it was a very simple project but now I'm back with a more refined and updated version of my litlle project. 

From here on I'll be preparing and posting new code lines and files one by one in this repository to have a good understanding of the changes I'm doing each hours.

For the dataaset I gathered music collection from GTZAN genre collection, The dataset is approximately 1.2GB, each genre has 100 audio clips in .wav format, so the total is 10 x 100 i.e. 1000 audio set. Though it is not availble now on their websites but you can download the dataset from the kaggle here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification
